<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p>
You are developing a Windows Store app. The app will use a model that is defined by using the following code. You need to create a class to represent a collection of <csharp>Customer</csharp> objects. The class will be used for data binding. The solution must ensure that if changes are made to the objects of the class, a notification will be sent to the user interface (UI) controls to which the collection is bound. How should you complete the signature for the collection class?</p>

AD Domain Services is the recommended and default technology for storing identity information (including the cryptographic keys that are the users' credentials). AD is required for default NTLM and Kerberos implementations, so the authentication protocol should be Kerberos: Data sent with Basic and Digest authentication is not encrypted. Moreover, Basic authentication credentials (user name and password) are sent as clear text and can be intercepted. The credential save option enumeration includes hidden (the "Save credentials?" dialog box is not displayed at all), unselected (the "Save credentials?" check box is not selected, indicating that the user doesn't want their credentials saved) and selected. The <csharp>CredentialPicker PickAsync</csharp> method displays a dialog box to the user and collects credentials from the user.

<h3>Question 12</h3>
<p>You are developing a Windows Store app that retrieves information from a social networking application by using web services. The web services require authentication. You need to recommend a solution to ensure that users are prompted for their credentials only the first time they use the app, even if the users are using the app from another device. What should you recommend?</p>
<ol class="plain">
	<li>The Credential Manager</li>
	<li>Roaming storage</li>
	<li>The Web Authentication Broker</li>
	<li class="right">The Credential Locker</li>
</ol>
<p class="tip">The web authentication broker enables single sign-on (SSO) for your users and seamlessly authenticate to a single service across multiple Windows Store apps. The web authentication broker supports the OAuth and OpenID internet authentication protocols, so you can integrate your app with a web service that provides user authentication. This allows you to utilize user identity in your apps from services such as Facebook, Flickr, Google, and Twitter.
</p>
<p class="tip">Credential Locker is a service that creates and maintains secure storage on the local computer that stores user names and passwords that the user saved from websites and Windows Store apps. In Windows 8, the Web Authentication Broker was introduced to help connect an app with resources on the web and manage the credentials. Credential Locker supports seamless sign in by using Windows Store apps that use Web Authentication Broker. It remembers passwords for services like Facebook and Twitter, so the user does not have to enter credentials multiple times. This seamless sign-in experience has been extended across the user's devices that are running Windows 8.1.</p>

<h3>Question 13</h3>
<p>
You are developing a Windows Store app that will back up video files. The app will support videos up to 1 GB in size. If users lose their device, they must be able to restore the video files to a new device. You need to recommend a storage solution for the app. Which storage solution should you recommend?</p>
<ol class="plain">
	<li class="right">windows Azure blob storage</li>
	<li>Roaming storage</li>
	<li>SQLite for Windows Runtime</li>
	<li>App Data</li>
</ol>

<p class="tip">Azure Blob storage is a service for storing large amounts of unstructured data that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS. A single blob can be hundreds of gigabytes in size, and a single storage account can contain up to 200 TB of blob, queue, and table data.
Common uses of Blob storage include:</p>
<ul class="tip">
	<li>Serving images or documents directly to a browser</li>
	<li>Storing files for distributed access</li>
	<li>Streaming video and audio</li>
	<li>Performing secure backup and disaster recovery</li>
	<li>Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service</li>

Dependency property metadata exists as an object that can be queried to examine the characteristics of a dependency property. This metadata is also accessed frequently by the property system as it processes any given dependency property. The Dependency Object Get/Set Value methods return or set the current effective value of a dependency property on this instance of a Dependency Object. Both methods take in the dependency property as their first argument (the set method has an overload that takes a dependency property key, but no such thing is defined in the code snippet).

<h3>Question 16</h3>
<p>
You are developing a Windows Store app that will be used to access large files stored online. The files will be shared between users worldwide. You need to recommend a solution to ensure that the users can download the files as quickly as possible. Which storage solution should you recommend?</p>
<ol class="plain">
	<li>A roaming folder</li>
	<li class="right">Microsoft Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)</li>
	<li>windows Azure Mobile Services</li>
	<li>SkyDrive</li>
</ol>
<p class="tip">The Microsoft Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers developers a global solution for delivering high-bandwidth content that's hosted in Azure. The CDN caches publicly available objects at strategically placed locations to provide maximum bandwidth for delivering content to users.</p>

<h3>Question 17</h3>
<p>
You are developing a Windows Store game. The game allows for interactive online play between users. The game authenticates users by using the credentials of a third-party site that provides OAuth2 authentication. You need to implement authentication that uses an implicit grant authorization. How should you complete the relevant code?

<h3>Question 24</h3>
<p>

	<li>Home or Work Networking</li>
	<li>Internet (Client & Server)</li>

	<li>Text Messaging</li>
	<li>Videos Library Access</li>
	<li class="right">Webcam</li>
</ul>
<p class="tip">To capture media, check the corresponding media-capturing devices. Windows Phone 8 supports Proximity communication using Near Field Communication (NFC).</p>

<h3>Question 25</h3>
<p>
You are developing a Windows Store app. You need to provide users with multiple ways to open the app. Each way must open a different page of the app. Which two components should you use?</p>

<ol class="plain">
	<li class="right">The <csharp>SecondaryTile</csharp> class</li>
	<li>ms-appx Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)</li>
	<li>The AppSettings file</li>
	<li>The <csharp>Frame.Navigate()</csharp> method</li>
	<li>Shortcuts that have parameters</li>
</ol>
<p class="tip">Secondary tiles are associated with a single parent app. They are pinned to the Start screen to provide a user with a consistent and efficient way to launch directly into a frequently used area of the parent app. This can be either a general subsection of the parent app that contains frequently updated content or a deep link to a specific area in the app.</p>
<p class="tip">URI schemes are used to refer to app files that come from the app’s package, data folders, or resources. The ms-appx and ms-appx-web schemes refer to app files that come from the app’s package (see App packages and deployment). Such files are typically static images, data, code, and layout files. The ms-appx-web scheme references these same files, but in the web compartment. The <xml>&lt;appSettings&gt;</xml> element stores custom application configuration information such as database connection strings, file paths, XML Web service URLs, or any information stored in an application’s .ini file.</p>

<h3>Question 26</h3>
<p>You are developing a Windows Store app that will display a toast notification. You need to ensure that when a toast notification is displayed, the first line of the notification is bold. Which template should you use?</p>
<ol>
	<li><csharp>TileSquareText03</csharp></li>
	<li class="right"><csharp>ToastImageAndText02</csharp></li>
	<li><csharp>TileSquareText01</csharp></li>
	<li><csharp>ToastlmageAndText01</csharp></li>
</ol>
<p class="tip">The ToastImageAndText02 template has a large image, one string of bold text on the first line and one string of regular text wrapped across the second and third lines.
</p>

<h3>Question 27</h3>
<p>You are developing a Windows Store app. You have the following requirements:
<ul>
	<li>The app tile must update every 30 minutes.</li>
	<li>Content must be pushed to the app tile from multiple URLs.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to schedule the app tile updates. How should you complete the relevant code?</p>

The <csharp>TileUpdateManager.CreateTileUpdaterForApplication</csharp> method creates and initializes a
new instance of the <csharp>TileUpdater</csharp>, which lets you update the calling app’s tile. You must enable the notification queue if you have not enabled it previously. Note that
the call to <csharp>EnableNotificationQueue</csharp> should be made only one time after the user installs the app or creates a secondary tile. This example code uses a previously defined variable called <csharp>pollUris</csharp>, an array of URI objects from which to get polled content. Windows can poll up to five different URIs to supply a set of content that cycles through the tile’s notification queue.

<h3>Question 30</h3>
<p>You are developing a Windows Store app. You need to ensure that the app meets the requirements for Windows Store certification. Which requirements must be met?</p>
<ol class="plain">
	<li>You must provide a screenshot of the app that is appropriate for the 16+ Windows Store Age Rating.</li>
	<li>The app must fully support touch input.</li>
	<li>You must provide at least two screenshots of the app.</li>
	<li class="right">Your app must have a privacy statement if it is network-capable.</li>
</ol>
<p class="tip"><b>A: Incorrect</b>. Your app and any ads within your app must conform to the store's content and age rating guidelines, and metadata must be appropriate. Apps with a rating over PEGI 16, ESRB MATURE, or that contain content that would warrant such a rating, are not allowed, unless the app is a game, is rated by a third party ratings board, and otherwise complies with these certification requirements. <b>B: Incorrect</b>. If your app doesn’t fully support touch input and fully support keyboard and mouse input, you must disclose that in the description elements of the app&mdash;but it is not a requirement. <b>C: Incorrect</b>. Historically, the screenshot requirement has been "at least one". Reference: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh694083.aspx">App certification requirements for the Windows Store</a>. <b>Important</b>: The App certification requirements for the Windows Store have been replaced by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn764944.aspx">Windows and Windows Phone Store Policies</a> as of October 23, 2014.</p>

<h3>Question 31</h3>

<ol class="plain">
	<li>Windows Azure blob storage</li>
	<li>Roaming storage</li>
	<li class="right">SkyDrive</li>
	<li>Windows Azure Mobile Services</li>
</ol>

<h3>Question 41</h3>
<p>You are developing a Windows Store app. You need to display a dialog box that will allow the user to choose from a list of credentials.
Which class should you use?</p>
<ol>
	<li><csharp>LSAuthenticationObject</csharp></li>
	<li class="right"><csharp>CredentialPicker</csharp></li>
	<li><csharp>PSCredential</csharp></li>
	<li><csharp>AuthenticationPicker</csharp></li>
	<li><csharp>LSCredentialFormContext</csharp></li>

<p class="tip">The CredentialPicker class (available in Windows only) creates an asynchronous object that displays a dialog box of credentials to the user and collects the user’s response.</p>

<h3>Question 42</h3>
<p>You are developing a medical record keeping app for a company. The app will be used by physicians in remote areas of the world. All data is highly sensitive and must be stored only in the company’s internal data center. The app is not allowed to connect directly to the company’s web service or internal network. You need to select a data access strategy that meets the requirements. Which remote data access strategy should you use?</p>

<ol class="plain">
	<li class="right">Connect to the company’s web service framework by using Windows Azure Connect.</li>
	<li>Use the <csharp>Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings</csharp> data store.</li>
	<li>Connect to Windows Azure Mobile Services and store the data in a SQL Azure database.</li>
	<li>Connect to a SQL Azure database and use SQL Data Sync.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Question 43</h3>
<p>You are developing a Windows Store app. The app will access several web resources that use an OAuth 2.0 authentication provider. You need to recommend in which class to store user credentials so that users do not have to reenter their credentials when they access the web resources. Which class should you recommend?</p>
<ol>
	<li><csharp>windows.Security.Authentication.OnlineId OnlineIdAuthenticator</csharp></li>
	<li><csharp>Windows.Security.Credentials.UI CredentialPicker</csharp></li>
	<li><csharp>system.Net NetworkCredential</csharp></li>
	<li class="right"><csharp>Windows.Security.Credentials PasswordVault</csharp></li>
</ol>

<p class="tip">The task of storing and retrieving user credentials securely and allowing user credentials roam at no cost with the user’s Microsoft account is simplified with the Credential Locker. Storing user credentials in the Credential Locker is a quick, two-step process:</p>
<ul class="tip">
	<li>Obtain a reference to the Credential Locker using the PasswordVault object from the <csharp>Windows.Security.Credentials</csharp> namespace.</li>
	<li>Create a <csharp>PasswordCredential</csharp> object that contains an identifier for your app, the username and the password, and pass that to the <csharp>PasswordVault.Add</csharp> method to add the credential to the locker.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question 44</h3>
<p>You are developing a Windows Store app to connect to a server and download files that are larger than 500 MB to the local file system.
You need to recommend a technology to download the files. Which technology should you recommend? (More than one answer choice may achieve the goal. Select the BEST answer.)</p>
<ol class="plain">
	<li class="right">Background Transfer</li>
	<li>XML HTTP Request</li>
	<li>web Sockets</li>
	<li>HTTP Client</li>
</ol>
<p class="tip">To provide a consistent experience when downloading larger media (video and music) with an operational lifetime that may span beyond multiple app suspensions and/or changes in network availability, your app can use Background Transfer.</p>
<p class="tip">You can use <csharp>XMLHttpRequest</csharp> to upload or download objects that are larger than a few MB, such as <csharp>Blob</csharp> objects and <csharp>FormData</csharp> objects, which may take a long time to complete, but since apps can be terminated at any time, you should consider using the Windows Runtime background transfer APIs for these operations.</p>

<h3>Question 45</h3>
<p>You are developing a Windows Store app. The app consumes data from a popular social networking site. The <csharp>requestUri</csharp> variable represents the address of the social networking site. The code contains an error. You need to identify the cause of the error.
You have the following code. Which line of code should you identify as causing the error?</p>

As in the classic MVC pattern, the model refers to either (a) a domain model which represents the real state content (an object-oriented approach), or (b) the data access layer that represents that content (a data-centric approach). As in the classic MVC pattern, the view refers to all elements displayed by the GUI such as buttons, labels, and other controls. The view model is a "model of the view" meaning it is an abstraction of the view that also serves in mediating between the view and the model which is the target of the view data bindings.

Case Study: 1
Scenario 1
Background
You are developing a Windows Store app by using C# and XAML. The app will allow users
to share and rate photos. The app will also provide information to users about photo
competitions.
Application Structure
The app stores data by using a class that is derived from the DataStoreBase class.
The app coordinates content between users by making calls to a centralized RESTful web
service.
The app has a reminder system that displays toast notifications when a photo competition is
almost over. The app gets the competition schedule data from the web service.
The app displays a list of images that are available for viewing in a data-bound list box. The
image file list stores paths to the image files. The app downloads new images from the web
service on a regular basis.
Relevant portions of the app files are shown. (Line numbers are included for reference only
and include a two-character prefix that denotes the specific file to which they belong.)
Business Requirements
The app must allow users to do the following:
Run the app on a variety of devices, including devices that have limited bandwidth
connections.
Share and synchronize high resolution photographs that are greater than 1 MB in size.
Rate each photo on a scale from 1 through 5.
Technical Requirements
The app must meet the following technical requirements:
Retain state for each user and each device.
Restore previously saved state each time the app is launched.
Preserve user state and photo edits when switching between this app and other apps.
When the app resumes after a period of suspension, refresh the user interface, tile
images, and data with current information from the web service.
Update the image list box as new images are added to the image file list.
Convert the image paths into images when binding the image file list to the list box.</p> <p>
The app must store cached images on the device only, and must display images or
notifications on the app tile to meet the following requirements:
Regularly update the app tile with random images from the user’s collection
displayed one at a time.
When a photo is displayed on the tile, one of the following badges must be displayed:
If the photo has a user rating, the tile must display the average user rating as a badge.
If the photo does not have a rating, the tile must display the Unavailable glyph as a badge.
Update the app tile in real time when the app receives a notification.
Display only the most recent notification on the app tile.
The app must display toast notifications to signal the end of a photo competition. The toast
notifications must meet the following requirements:
Display toast notifications based on the schedule that is received from the web service.
Display toast notifications for as long as possible.
Display toast notifications regardless of whether the app is running.
When a user clicks a toast notification that indicates the end of the photo
competition, the app must display the details of the photo competition that triggered
the toast notification.

Background
You are developing a Windows Store app named Picture Sharer. The app will allow users to
capture, modify, caption, and share pictures.
Application Structure

foreground color might change in the future.
The following code defines a custom button style named ButtonStyleRed:
<code>

&lt;Style TargecType="Buccon" x:Key="ButconScyleRed"&gt;
&lt;Setcer Property="Foreground" Value="#FFC34343,'/&gt;

</csharp>
Relevant portions of the app files are shown. (Line numbers are included for reference only
and include a two-character prefix that denotes the specific file to which they belong.)
Business Requirements
The app must meet the following business requirements:
Allow users to capture and retrieve pictures, modify pictures by adding a shading
effect, and add captions to images.
Support only Landscape and Landscape-flipped orientations.
Ensure that users can select and modify imaqes from the PictureChooserPaqe page.
Ensure that users can change the magnification of the selected image and resize the
image by using pinch and stretch gestures. Scaling should be fluid and precisely
controlled by the user.
The app must be localized for the French Canadian market.
Technical Requirements
The app must meet the following technical requirements:
Scroll bars must not be visible.
The CaptionTextBlock and CaptionTextBox controls must appear side by side,
without overlapping and on the same line. The CaptionTextBox control should
appear to the right of the CaptionTextBlock control.
The ContactPicker object must be filtered to display only email addresses.
Minimize the code that is required to implement optical zoom functionality.
You must perform the following tasks:
Handle the Click event of the GetPictureButton control to switch from the current
page to the PictureChooserPage page.
After the user selects an image on the PictureChooserPage page, ensure that the app
navigates back to the PictureSharerMainPage page.</p> <p>
Track the current screen orientation and page size by updating the
_currentViewState, _currentHeight, and _currentWidth fields every time the screen
orientation or page size changes.
Create a style named ButtonStyleWhite that inherits all the style settings of the
ButtonStyleRed style except the border color; the border color must be white. The
ButtonStyleWhite style must automatically update with any changes that are made
to the ButtonStyleRed style.
Create a resource named ButtonForegroundColor to implement the button
foreground color so that it can be referenced in XAML by using the following
standard syntax: Foreground-“{StaticResourceButtonForegroundColor}”
Ensure that the OnNavigatedTo() method updates the current picture when a new
picture is selected.
Change the background for the root Grid element to a vertical gradient that
transitions from black at the top to maroon at the bottom. Create a resource named
GridBackgroundGradientBrush to hold the requested gradient.
While testing the app, you observe the following results:
An exception is being thrown in the GetContactsCompleted event handler when the
retrieved email address is assigned to the RecipientsTextBlock control. The exception
message states: “The application called an interface that was marshalled for a
different thread.”
When users navigate away from the PictureSharerMainPage page, information that
was entered in the CaptionTextBox control is lost.

To create the resource file, add a folder named fr-FR to your project, and then add a
resource file named Resources.resw to the folder.
* In Windows Store apps, you designate the names of localized resource files by creating a
folder to store the resources and images of a supported culture. You can then describe the
resource by using the culture name (such as “ko-kr”) followed by the default resource name
and resource file extension (such as “ko-kr\Resources.resw”).

After the user selects an image on the PictureChooserPage page, ensure that the app
navigates back to the PictureSharerMainPage page.</p> <p>
Track the current screen orientation and page size by updating the
_currentViewState, _currentHeight, and _currentWidth fields every time the screen
orientation or page size changes.
Create a style named ButtonStyleWhite that inherits all the style settings of the
ButtonStyleRed style except the border color; the border color must be white. The
ButtonStyleWhite style must automatically update with any changes that are made
to the ButtonStyleRed style.
Create a resource named ButtonForegroundColor to implement the button
foreground color so that it can be referenced in XAML by using the following
standard syntax: Foreground-“{StaticResourceButtonForegroundColor}”
Ensure that the OnNavigatedTo() method updates the current picture when a new
picture is selected.
Change the background for the root Grid element to a vertical gradient that
transitions from black at the top to maroon at the bottom. Create a resource named
GridBackgroundGradientBrush to hold the requested gradient.

An exception is being thrown in the GetContactsCompleted event handler when the

message states: “The application called an interface that was marshalled for a
different thread.”
When users navigate away from the PictureSharerMainPage page, information that
was entered in the CaptionTextBox control is lost.

Scenario 2
Background
You are developing a Windows Store app named Picture Sharer. The app will allow users to
capture, modify, caption, and share pictures.
Application Structure
The SharelmageButton and GetContactsButton controls use the same foreground color. The
foreground color might change in the future.
The following code defines a custom button style named ButtonStyleRed:
<code>

&lt;Style TargecType="Buccon" x:Key="ButconScyleRed"&gt;
&lt;Setcer Property="Foreground" Value="#FFC34343,'/&gt;
&lt;Setter Property—'Border3rushn Value—,#FFC34343"/&gt;
…
&lt;/Style&gt;
</csharp>
Relevant portions of the app files are shown. (Line numbers are included for reference only
and include a two-character prefix that denotes the specific file to which they belong.)
Business Requirements
The app must meet the following business requirements:
Allow users to capture and retrieve pictures, modify pictures by adding a shading
effect, and add captions to images.
Support only Landscape and Landscape-flipped orientations.
Ensure that users can select and modify imaqes from the PictureChooserPaqe page.
Ensure that users can change the magnification of the selected image and resize the
image by using pinch and stretch gestures. Scaling should be fluid and precisely
controlled by the user.
The app must be localized for the French Canadian market.
Technical Requirements
The app must meet the following technical requirements:
Scroll bars must not be visible.
The CaptionTextBlock and CaptionTextBox controls must appear side by side,
without overlapping and on the same line. The CaptionTextBox control should
appear to the right of the CaptionTextBlock control.
The ContactPicker object must be filtered to display only email addresses.
Minimize the code that is required to implement optical zoom functionality.
You must perform the following tasks:
Handle the Click event of the GetPictureButton control to switch from the current
page to the PictureChooserPage page.
After the user selects an image on the PictureChooserPage page, ensure that the app
navigates back to the PictureSharerMainPage page.</p> <p>

<u>
Explanation:</u></p> <p>
* To enable a page to be cached, set NavigationCacheMode to either Enabled or Required.
The difference in behavior is that Enabled might not be cached if the frame’s cache size limit
(CacheSize) is exceeded, whereas Required always generates an entry no matter the size
limit.
