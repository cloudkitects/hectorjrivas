<h3>Question 16</h3>
<p>You are developing an ASP.NET MVC web application for viewing a list of contacts. The application is designed for devices that support changes in orientation, such as tablets and smartphones. The application displays a grid of contact tiles in portrait mode. When the orientation changes to landscape, each tile in the grid expands to include each contact’s details. The HTML that creates the tiled interface resembles the following markup:</p>
<table id="tbcode" name="tbcode">
<tr>
<td><pre class="HTML"></pre></td>
<td><pre class="HTML"></pre></td>
<td>
<textarea class="code">
&amp;lt;ul class="contacts"&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;img src="..."/&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Details&amp;lt;div/&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
</textarea>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The CSS used to style the tiles in landscape mode is as follows:</p>
<table id="tbcode" name="tbcode">
<tr>
<td><pre class="HTML"></pre></td>
<td><pre class="HTML"></pre></td>
<td>
<textarea class="code">
ul.contacts > li
{
	width: 150px;
}
ul.contacts > li > div
{
	display: block;
}
</textarea>
</td>

<p>If this CSS is omitted, the existing CSS displays the tiles in landscape mode. You need to update the portrait mode CSS to apply only to screens with a width less than 500 pixels. Which code segment should you use?</p>

<h2>Case Study: 1 Scenario 1</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application in Visual Studio 2012 that will be used by Olympic marathon runners to log data about training runs.
<h3>Business Requirements</h3>
<p>The application stores date, distance, and duration information about a user’s training runs. The user can view, insert, edit, and delete records. The application must be optimized for accessibility. All times must be displayed in the user’s local time.</p>
<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
<p><b>Data Access</b>: Database access is handled by a public class named <csharp>RunnerLog.DataAccess.RunnerLogDb</csharp>. All data retrieval must be done by HTTP GET and all data updates must be done by HTTP POST.</p>
<p><b>Layout</b>: All pages in the application use a master layout file named <csharp>\Views\Shared\_Layout.cshtml</csharp>.</p>
<p><b>Models</b>: The application uses the <csharp>\Models\LogModel.cs</csharp> model.</p>
<p><b>Views</b>: All views in the application use the Razor view engine. Four views located in <csharp>\Views\RunLog</csharp> are named:</p>
<ul>
	<li>_CalculatePace.cshtml</li>
	<li>EditLog.cshtml</li>
	<li>GetLog.cshtml</li>
	<li>InsertLog.cshtml</li>
</ul>
<p>The application also contains a <csharp>\Views\Home\Index.cshtml</csharp> view.</p>
<p><b>Controllers</b>: The application contains a <csharp>\Controllers\RunLogController.cs</csharp> controller.</p>
<p><b>Images</b>: A <csharp>stopwatch.png</csharp> image is located in the <csharp>\Images</csharp> folder.</p>
<p><b>Videos</b>: A map of a runner’s path is available when a user views a run log. The map is implemented as an Adobe Flash application and video. The browser should display the video natively if possible, using H264, Ogg, or WebM formats, in that order. If the video cannot be displayed, then the Flash application should be used.</p>
<p><b>Security</b>: You have the following security requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The application is configured to use forms authentication.</li>
	<li>Users must be logged on to insert runner data.\</li>
	<li>Users must be members of the Admin role to edit or delete runner data.</li>
	<li>There are no security requirements for viewing runner data.</li>
	<li>You need to protect the application against cross-site request forgery.</li>
	<li>Passwords are hashed by using the SHA1 algorithm.</li>
	<li><csharp>RunnerLog.Providers.RunLogRoleProvider.es</csharp> contains a custom role provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relevant portions of the application files follow.</p>
