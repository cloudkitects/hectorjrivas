<p>You are developing a code-based solution to parse the contents of the XML file and display the information on the page. The solution must work on both modern and older browsers. You need to display the information from the XML file onto the page. How should you create the JavaScript code? (Develop the solution by selecting the required code segments in the correct order)</p>

<p>You are validating user input by using JavaScript and regular expressions. A group of predefined regular expressions will validate two input fields: An email address in a function named validateEmail (for example, firstname@contoso.com) A nine-digit number that allows optional hyphens after the second and fifth character in a function named validateSSN(for example, 555555555 or 555-55-5555) You need to use the correct expression to validate the input.
