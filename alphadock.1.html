<h2>WPF Docking Done Right</h2>

<p><img src="../sitebuilderpictures/alphadock.0.jpg" align="right" class="imgfigure" width="500">
After hitting a wall when stretching the native WPF dock panel control, I decided to play around with the open source frameworks available.
</p>
<p>I was partial to Synergy’s <a href="http://mixmodessynergy.codeplex.com/">WPF Toolkit</a>, a good start point for understanding what exactly is required
for a docking framework (such as commands, behaviors, adorners, etc.) but it does not implement the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel">Model-View-View Model</a> (MVVM) paradigm.
</p>
<p>I then discovered Xceed’s <a href="https://avalondock.codeplex.com/">Avalon Dock 2.0</a> framework, which is one of the most comprehensive docking frameworks
out there—and also part of a large toolkit. It supports MVVM and is based on the use of templates and themes. Additionally it implements regionalization via
resources, handles interoperation with the OS nicely and uses most features of WPF/XAML, C# and OOP, such as interfaces, extensions, subclass polymorphism,
singletons, etc.
</p>
<p>I will assume my audience is proficient in C# and very familiar with WPF/XAML; I will brush on concepts, frameworks and paradigms around it, including
references wherever possible.</p>
<h3>Why MVVM?</h3>
<p>We can trace the MVVM paradigm all the way back to Edsger W. Dijkstra  and his 1974 paper, <a
href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD447.html">"On
the role of scientific thought"</a>, where he introduces the concept of <i>Separation of Concerns</i>, in a nutshell the idea of splitting your
software program into sections addressing different concerns.
</p>
<p>In MVVM we split the program into the <b>Model</b> section (short for Data Model, or in Entity-Framework parlance, an Entity), the <b>View Model</b>,
which encapsulates an instance of the Model and the methods and rules (the logic) for manipulating it, as well as the properties displayed by the <b>View</b>,
the GUI window, page or control used to display and interact with the Model. Suffice it to say that the view is loosely coupled to the view model, hence
separating the concern of updating the model from that of updating the view.
</p>
<p>In WPF/XAML parlance, the View Model is the <b>Data Context</b> of the View (thanks be to Microsoft), and the Model properties to display or interact with are
set via data <b>bindings</b>. Adding a new property to the model obviously requires adding some wiring to the view model and adding a new GUI element with
a binding to the view, but these tasks are no longer a concern for the model developer: these are now concerns for the programmer and the interface or
user experience (UX) designer respectively. Similarly, the UX designer can apply styles and entire themes to the GUI with little concern-and lower risk-of affecting
the model.
</p>
<p>
If you happen to wear the three hats (data architect, developer and designer), the model still helps you in keeping concerns separate: start from the model, wire
the view model and then change the view-or design a magnificent control wired with default values so that it is ready for anything you throw at it.
</p>
<p>Of course the MVVM design pattern is not perfect or ideal for all situations: the boundary between business and presentation logic is blurry at best, and wiring
the view model is obviously concerned with both the model and the view. Nonetheless, the pattern is still a good one and it has stood the test of time as a
productivity booster.
</p>

<h3>Why Refactor Avalon Dock?</h3>

<p>For entirely academic purposes-namely to teach myself how it works, how to develop WPF custom controls and to improve on its current documentation.
I also wanted to use different names and naming conventions, strip it down to its very minimum (eliminating unreferenced code) and extend or improve on it;
ultimately I refactor most code because I get a kick out of it.
</p>
<p>This is hardly a developer's reference for Avalon Dock, given I changed so many type and property names, but it can be used as such if you keep in mind that I
removed the word "Layout" from the layout interfaces and classes, and replaced "Anchorable" with "Tool".
</p>
<p>Just to be sure, the framework's goal is to provide a user interface that allows dragging, floating, dropping and docking documents and tools, as well as groups
of documents and tools. It also aims at doing it in MVVM fashion and using WPF themes.
</p>
<h3>Layout Interfaces</h3>
<p>
How do you support polymorphism in C# when a class can only inherit from a single class? By inheriting from one or more interfaces. An interface is basically a
class that declares properties, methods and/or events but does not implement them: it is a signature, a blueprint or a contract for inheritors so that they are
enforced to implement them.
</p>
<p>
The next diagram presents the layout interfaces of the docking framework. Hover over each interface for a peek into its intended purpose.
</p>
<ul id="map1">
<li><p class="IElement"><span><b>IElement</b><br/>
The base <i>element</i> public interface, which derives from WPF’s System Component Model interfaces for notifying data bound clients that data is changing or has changed.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="IRenderable"><span><b>IRenderable</b><br/>
A public contract for implementing whether an element is visible or not.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="IFloatable"><span><b>IFloatable</b><br/>
A public contract for keeping track of an element’s floating position and size.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="IDockable"><span><b>IDockable</b><br/>
A public contract for keeping track of an element’s docked position and size.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="IContainer"><span><b>IContainer</b><br/>
A public contract for an element that wraps a collection of child elements, and declares methods for removing and replacing elements in the collection.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="IHidableContainer"><span><b>IHidableContainer</b><br/>
A public contract for a hidable container.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="IHidable"><span><b>IHidable</b><br/>
A public interface that enforces the computation of the visibility of a container based on the visibility of its children.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="IGroup"><span><b>IGroup</b><br/>
A public contract that enforces the implementation of methods to access container elements at random.
<br/>
<br/>
A group also enforces inheritors to implementing an event handler when the children collection is updated.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="IOrientableGroup"><span><b>IOrientableGroup</b><br/>
A public interface that enforces the implementation of WPF’s plane Orientation property on inheritors.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="IPane"><span><b>IPane</b><br/>
A public contract for a <i>pane</i>: a renderable, hidable container, in turn, a separate area for the display of and interaction with other elements or groups
of elements.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="IRendered"><span><b>IRendered</b><br/>
An internal contract for keeping track of an element’s actual dimensions after the entire visual tree has been laid out.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="ITransferrable"><span><b>ITransferrable</b><br/>
An internal interface for keeping track of the previous container when dragging elements or moving them from one container to another.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="ISerializable"><span><b>ISerializable</b><br/>
An internal interface that enforces the implementation of an ID property for serialization purposes.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="IRootLayout"><span><b>IRootLayout</b><br/>
A public contract for the root visual layout, incorporating view models for docking sites (sides and center panel), as well as observable
collections of floating windows and hidden tools.
<br/>
<br/>
The root layout must also keeps track of the currently active content, hold a reference to the <i>docking manager</i>--the object
in charge of operations--and cleanup after itself.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="IContentSelector"><span><b>IContentSelector</b><br/>
A public interface for keeping track of the selected content in containers with multiple content.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="IUpdateStrategy"><span><b>IUpdateStrategy</b><br/>
A public interface for actions that take place before or after an element is inserted in the framework.
</span></p></li>

<li><p class="IControl"><span><b>IControl</b><br/>
A public interface for controls (views) requiring the implementation of the view model property.
</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="pfigure">Figure 1. Layout Interfaces</p>

<p>It all starts with the base <i>element</i> interface, which derives
from the WPF’s <a
href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel(v=vs.110).aspx">System
Component Model</a> interfaces for notifying data bound clients that data is
changing or has changed.</p>

<p>An element in the docking framework holds a reference to its
parent element—the element that contains it—and to its root element—a special
kind of ancestor of the element if you will, once you follow the chain of
parents all the way up.</p>

<p>An element implementing the <i>renderable</i> interface must expose
whether it is visible or not. This is crucial to the whole framework: when an
element’s visibility changes it must notify its parent so that it in turn has
an opportunity to show or hide itself.</p>

<p>The <i>floatable</i> interface is a contract for keeping track of an
element’s floating position and size; conversely the <i>dockable</i> interface keeps
track of a docked element’s position and size; notice that a dockable element
is necessarily floatable (and draggable). Similarly, the <i>rendered</i> interface
keeps track of the actual size of something rendered by WPF after the entire
visual tree has been laid out.</p>

<p>The <i>container</i> interface wraps a collection of child elements,
and declares methods for removing and replacing elements in the collection.</p>

<p>The <i>group</i> interface is a contract for a random access
container: you can get the index of the passed-in element and insert, remove or replace at the passed-in position. It is also an active container, notifying
of any changes to the collection. The <i>orientable group</i> interface additionally
demands the implementation of WPF’s horizontal or vertical plane Orientation
property.</p>

<p>The other branch of containers are <i>panes</i>, separate areas for
the display of and interaction with other elements or groups of elements. A
pane in the docking framework is a renderable, <i>hidable</i> container. The hidable
interface imposes the computation of the visibility of a container based on the
visibility of its children. A hidable container—and therefore, a pane—must also implement the move and remove at methods.</p>

<p>Other helper interfaces include the <i>transferable</i> interface,
for keeping track of the previous container when moving elements from one container to another or floating them, the <i>serializable</i>
interface, for imposing an ID property to implementers, and the <i>content
selector</i> interface, for keeping track of the selected content in containers
with multiple content.</p>
